<h1>the ellusive "we"</h1>

<p>on this page I will try to think about something that's felt weird for a bit
along with a friend. And maybe with more than just one fren ovwr time. or not huehue.
</p>

<p>so long story short - the dissonance has been with the framing of "we". Specifically with being confused about how the language surrounding a "we", can sometimes connotate a kind of energy that feels exciting, whereas others, even when objectively well intentioned, feeling off.
